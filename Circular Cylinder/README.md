# Circular Cylinder

COE 347: Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics

Spring 2023

This project was a simulation of a two-dimensional cross-section of a canonical circular cyliner flow. The simulation was executed at various Reynolds numbers to verify that it exhibits vortex shedding when it should. The source data is very large and intense, even for such a simple case, so I chose to only post some videos. Those are fun part anyways. The simulation took over 5 hours to run in parallel on a node at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/), all to create a sped-up 30-second video!
