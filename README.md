# Academic
These are assorted assignments and projects from my academic career worth sharing. Most apply numerical methods to solve complex engineering problems. Programming languages include MATLAB, C++, and Python. I personally find them unique and interesting. I hope you do too!

Note that some content has been redacted to honor academic integrity and professor's wishes. If you would like to learn more about my work, I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have if you contact me directly.
