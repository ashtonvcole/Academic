# Academic
Assorted assignments and projects from my academic career worth sharing. Most apply numerical methods to solve complex engineering problems. Programming languages include MATLAB, C++, and Python.

Note that some projects have redacted content to honor academic integrity and professor's wishes. If you would like to learn more about my work, I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
