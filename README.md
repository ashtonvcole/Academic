# Academic
These are assorted assignments and projects from my academic career worth sharing. Most apply numerical methods to solve complex engineering problems. Programming languages include MATLAB, C++, and Python. I personally find them unique and interesting. I hope you do too! They demonstrate not only proficiency in engineering and programming topics, but a strong work ethic and meticulous attention to detail. I tend towards being thorough and thoughtful, while still producing a clean and complete final product. However, I think it is far better to just show you than harp about it.

Note that some content has been redacted to honor academic integrity and professor's wishes. If you would like to learn more about my work, I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have if you contact me directly.
