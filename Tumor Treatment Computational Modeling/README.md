# Tumor Treatment Computational Modeling

COE 311K: Engineering Computation

Fall 2021

This project uses numerical methods to solve a nonlinear system of differential equations which model a tumor subjected to an arbitrary drug treatment. Drug dosages are optimized to minimize an arbitrary multivariable cost function, which could represent toxic or undesirable side effects. Coding was conducted in MATLAB on a team of 5, but the report was written individually.

This was one of my first major projects in Computational Engineering. It was exciting to apply software and numerical methods skills to tackle a complex real-world-inspired problem. It also holds some personal significance, since my mother was diagnosed with cancer in 2010. She has thankfully achieved remission and a full recovery, but the sad truth is that there are not enough organ donors in the United States. Whether it be that a good match isn't found, or the cancer is caught in a late stage, hundreds die each year waiting for a donor. Prior to a transplant, she went through chemotherapy and radiation treatments, which slowed the tumor's growth, but also came with a toxicity cost. In the extreme, these treatments would become harmful or even fatal, making for a difficult balance to strike. Computer models like this simplified one can play a valuable role in optimizing treatment courses to balance these factors, with the potential to save lives.
