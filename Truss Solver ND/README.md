# Truss Solver ND

COE 321K: Computational Methods for Structural Analysis

Spring 2023

This is a simple finite element solver for an any-dimensional truss. It is the culmination of multiple homework assignments over several weeks. I went above and beyond to write a generalized Python-based solver with a Tkinter GUI. The results were extremely satisfying. After a heavy front load of development, I could easily apply it to new problem sets, with subtle expansions in functionality. Only the final solver is included. Several assignment writeups are also included.
