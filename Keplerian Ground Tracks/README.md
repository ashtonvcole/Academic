# Keplerian Ground Tracks

ASE 366K: Spacecraft Dynamics
Spring 2022

This project propagates and plots ground tracks from orbital elements. It assumes a simple, analytical Keplerian system, accounting for the rotation of Earth but not orbital procession and gravitational nuances. The result looks like what you might see at Mission Control in Houston. It is a great demonstration of complex coordinate system and frame of reference transformations with vector and matrix operations in MATLAB.
